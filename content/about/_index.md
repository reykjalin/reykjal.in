My name is Kristófer Reykjalín Þorláksson and I'm a software engineer with experience in software architecture design, development, testing, and system administration.

This blog is mainly focused on issues I've encountered while at work or working on personal projects, and how I solved (or didn't solve) those issues.

My hope is that documenting my issues online will provide some help and assistance for others.

If you're looking for my CV, you can find it [here](cv).
